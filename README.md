This was done as a part of the Intro to Data Science MOOC. It involves the following:

-access the twitter Application Programming Interface(API) using python

-estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase

-analyze the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data

Usage:
First run twitterstream.py to collect tweets from the livestream and write the output to a file

./twitterstream.py > output.txt

The other functions then use output.txt and the pre-computed sentiment file AFINN-111.txt.
